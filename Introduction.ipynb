    "Kickstarter is a platform for creators or companies to gain funding for their projects through crowdfunding on the Internet. This project attempts to predict whether a Kickstarter campaign would be successful or would fail. Through data analysis and visualization we found that different characteristics such as the goal and category of the campaign were distinctly different depending on whether the Kickstarter failed or succeeded. We fit two classification models, a Logistic Regression and a Random Forest, for purposes of making our predictions. Each model had the same accuracy at around 64%. Given the random nature in regards to the success of Kickstarters, this accuracy is satisfactory. Going forward, more predictor variables related to the marketing or donation rewards of the campaigns could improve clarity and prediction of outcome."

    "Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform where people can pledge money to different projects, called campaigns, ranging from anything such as films, music, video games, and technology. These people who donate or pledge money are called backers who collectively give money until a goal set by the creator of the campaign. These people often back the project with the idea that if the goal is reached, the project will be carried out in full and they are able to buy it or use it in some way. If the Kickstarter fails, there is no guarantee that they will get their money back. Furthermore, there is time pressure to reach the goal as the fund raising period can only be of a finite length. This in mind, it is often critical to evaluate the viability of the kickstarter before giving one's money to the project.\n",
