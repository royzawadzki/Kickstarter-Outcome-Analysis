#Abstract
Kickstarter is a platform for creators or companies to gain funding for their projects through crowdfunding on the Internet. This project attempts to predict whether a Kickstarter campaign would be successful or would fail. Through data analysis and visualization we found that different characteristics such as the goal and category of the campaign were distinctly different depending on whether the Kickstarter failed or succeeded. We fit two classification models, a Logistic Regression and a Random Forest, for purposes of making our predictions. Each model had the same accuracy at around 64%. Given the random nature in regards to the success of Kickstarters, this accuracy is satisfactory. Going forward, more predictor variables related to the marketing or donation rewards of the campaigns could improve clarity and prediction of outcome.
